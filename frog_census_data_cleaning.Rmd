## Melbourne Water Frog Census Data Exploration

The following code chunk reads the .csv file, corrects some spellings of some names of species, formats the date column, converts the data to a dataframe, and creates a new column each for year and month. 

Entries in the "Type_of_observation" are then collated into larger groups to reduce the number of levels in this variable.  For example, 'frog census - sound r' and 'frog census (AVW code' are edited to simply 'frog census'.

The new newly cleaned dataframe (frogs.df) is filtered for years greater than 2000 and then saved as frogs_2001.csv.
```{r}
frogs_2001 <- frogs.df %>% filter(year>2000)

View(frogs_2001)
```

Missing values are confirmed to be zero.
A list of all frog species from the post-2001 data is printed to check for any further spelling errors.

```{r}

This dataset includes a field for 'type of observation'. This field can be used to identify the data that is most likely associated with the frog census. There are 57 different types of observations. However, distinctions between the types are not always clear. 

The earliest observation dates back to the 15th of January, 1960. Observations before 2001 were left out of this study because they were not part of the frog census and are perhaps less likely to be accurate.

Since 2001, at least 47.11% of observations have been part of a frog census and have been coded as either "frog census", "frog census AVW", and "frog census-sound recording".  Recordings in which the type of observation was left blank account for 20.93%. Other common types of observations include Opportunistic recording 6.67%, General Observations 6.62%, "Heard during bird survey" at 6.43%. 

The code chunk below produces a bar chart of the 8 most common types of observations in the data from 2001.

```{r}

obs_types_totals <- frogs_2001 %>% group_by(Type_of_observation) %>% summarise(Count=n())

#Observations before 2001
79.23% of observations before 2001 are listed as incidental, 8.72% are coded as general observations and 4.64% as spotlighting. As only 0.04% are coded as blank. It could be that unknown observation types were coded as incidental.

## Frog Census Date Compared with Other Data

Only 18 frog species were noted prior to 2001. There are a total of 22 frog species in the dataset.

Looking at a plot of the frog census data versus the other data that has been collected we can immediately see a sharp increase at 2017. There was a noted spike in data collection as part of the frog census because of the enthusiastic adoption of Melbourne Water's frog watch app. Over time data may have been coded differently so it is not possible to say for sure which data was linked to the frog census efforts, especially as so much data has been coded as general

```{r}
# create data set with only observations type as frog census
frog_census <- frogs.df %>% filter(Type_of_observation=="Frog Census")
# create data set excluding frog census observation type
other <- frogs.df %>% filter(Type_of_observation!="Frog Census")
# group new datasets by year for plotting
census_yearly <- frog_census %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(Count=n())
other_yearly <- other %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(Count=n())
# merge the census yearly and the other yearly onto the same dataset
yearly <- merge(x=census_yearly,y=other_yearly, by="year", all.x=TRUE) 
# Rename count Columns:
yearly <- yearly %>% rename(Census=Count.x, Other=Count.y)
# replace NA with 0 in Other column (frog census data includes all years):
yearly$Other[is.na(yearly$Other)]<- 0
#convert year to date class:
yearly$year <- as.numeric(yearly$year)
# filter data <2001
yearly <- yearly %>% filter(year>2000)
# Collapse two variables of census and other into one variable:
library("tidyverse")
yearly <- yearly %>%
  select(year, Census, Other) %>%
  gather(key = "Group", value = "Count", -year)
# create line plot for census and other data by year:
# first prep for the x axis to be continous and only show every 5 years;
# set a sequence for the number of breaks ie; every year
breaks <-seq(2001,2018,by=1)
# create a function that puts labels only on every 5 years
label_list <- vector(mode="list", length=length(breaks))
i <- 1
for (date in breaks){

## Less observed frogs:

Plains Brown frog hasn't been seen since 2008.
Dendy's Toadlet not seen since 2009.
